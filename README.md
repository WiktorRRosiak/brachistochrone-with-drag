# brachistochrone-with-drag
Polish Physics Olympiad, stage I, part II, exercise 4
For a limited range of curves containing points (0,0) and (100,-1), namely parabolas only, select one that has the lowest rolling time for a ideal sphere, with no friction but with drag (air).
This will eventually become a program capable of finding brachistochrones from (0,0) to any point below X axis.
